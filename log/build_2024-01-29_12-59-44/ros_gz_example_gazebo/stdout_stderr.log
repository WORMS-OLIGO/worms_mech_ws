[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:26 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findgz-sim7.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "gz-sim7", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "gz-sim7" with any
  of the following names:

    gz-sim7Config.cmake
    gz-sim7-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "gz-sim7" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "gz-sim7_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "gz-sim7" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
